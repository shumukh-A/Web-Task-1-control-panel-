# Web-Task-1-control-panel
In this project, a website was created for the robot dashboard. The site consists of five buttons, "Up", "Left", "Stop", "Right", and "Down". These buttons are used to control the movement of the robot. A "MySQL" database was also created and linked to the html website. When you click a button, the action will be stored in the database using PHP codes.
